        <h2>Planes</h2>
        <p>
            Planes, or airplanes, are marvels of modern engineering and a critical component of global transportation. They are powered, fixed-wing aircraft that use engines or propellers to generate the thrust needed for flight. Planes have revolutionized the way humans travel, enabling people and goods to move quickly across continents and oceans. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, from small personal aircraft to enormous commercial airliners capable of carrying hundreds of passengers. Military planes, such as fighter jets and bombers, are designed for speed, agility, and combat, while cargo planes prioritize capacity and durability for transporting goods. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first successful powered flight was achieved by the Wright brothers in 1903, marking the beginning of a new era. Since then, aviation technology has evolved dramatically. Modern planes are equipped with advanced navigation systems, fuel-efficient engines, and improved safety features. The use of aerodynamics and lightweight materials enhances performance, making long-haul flights more efficient and sustainable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond passenger transport, planes play a vital role in emergency services, scientific research, and recreation. They are indispensable in disaster relief operations, where they deliver aid to remote areas. Planes also contribute to environmental studies by collecting data on weather patterns and atmospheric conditions. Whether for business, leisure, or exploration, planes connect people and places in ways once thought impossible.

        <h2>Ryanair</h2>
        <p>
            Ryanair is an Irish ultra-low-cost airline that has become synonymous with affordable air travel. Founded in 1984, the airline began as a small carrier operating a single route between Waterford, Ireland, and London, England. Today, it is one of the largest airlines in the world, operating a fleet of over 600 aircraft, primarily Boeing 737s. Ryanair’s business model focuses on minimizing operational costs and offering passengers the lowest possible fares, often undercutting competitors by a significant margin. This strategy includes charging separately for optional services such as checked luggage, seat selection, and in-flight meals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The airline's success is largely attributed to the deregulation of the European aviation industry in the 1990s, which allowed Ryanair to expand rapidly across the continent. With hubs at major airports like Dublin, London Stansted, and Milan Bergamo, Ryanair serves over 200 destinations in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Its extensive network and aggressive pricing strategy have made it the airline of choice for budget-conscious travelers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ryanair has also invested in sustainability initiatives, aiming to reduce its environmental impact. The airline has committed to operating more fuel-efficient planes and optimizing flight paths to lower emissions. Despite its success, Ryanair is not without controversy, often facing criticism for its strict policies and additional fees. Nevertheless, it continues to grow, with millions of passengers choosing Ryanair each year for its unbeatable fares and extensive route options. The airline’s impact on the aviation industry is undeniable, as it has reshaped the market and made air travel accessible to a broader audience.
